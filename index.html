    <p>The Von Neumann architecture's components are: 
    <p>A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers.</p>
    <p>A control unit that contains an intruction register and program counter.</p>
    <p>Memory that stores data and instructions.</p>
    <p>External mass storage</p>
    <p>Input and output mechanisms.</p>
    <h3>2.  What is user space?</h3>
    <p>The term user space refers to all code that runs outside the operating system's kernel. 
        Usually refers to various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact

        the kernal API just as any other program. </p>
    <h3>5. What is the main task of the shell?</h3>
    <p>The main task is to read, write, and execute programs.</p>

    <h3>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
        The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be

        the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
        the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
        changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
        menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
