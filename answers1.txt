1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture
   The Von Neumann architecture's components are: 
   * A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers.
   * A control unit that contains an intruction register and program counter.
   * Memory that stores data and instructions. 
   * External mass storage
   * Input and output mechanisms.

2. What is user space?
   The term user space refers to all code that runs outside the operating system's kernel. 
   Usually refers to various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact 
   with the kernel: software that performs input, output, manipulates file system objects,
   application software and more. "Everything the a normal user interacts with can be considered
   the user space". 

3. What is the shell?
   A shell is a CLI (Command-line interpreter) which allows the user to access the OS's services.    

4. Where is the shell located?
   The shell is not directly located in the kernal, but are usually special applications that use
   the kernal API just as any other program. 

5. What is the main task of the shell?
   The main task is to read, write, and execute programs.
